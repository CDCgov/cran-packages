## Overview

Checks [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) information for packages
authored or maintained by CDC employees, or those that declare CDC
funding. Looks in the undocumented file `packages.rds` as suggested by
[Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen) in in [this `stackoverflow`
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8830439). While there is no
guarantee that the file will continue to be available, it exists *at
least* since Jan 2012, when that answer was provided.

Looks for `CDC`, `cdc.gov`, and `Disease Control` in the author and
maintainer fields for all packages listed in CRAN. It does not look for
archived packages.

## Usage

Unless you expect or know the file to have moved locations, the default
`url` should be fine. Unless you want to try different search patterns,
the default `regex` should be fine.
